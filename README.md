Final Project for Kapenga's CS3400

### Updates

---

12/8/13 @ 3:00 _Jacob_ - Added animations for linear velocity, angular velocity, and oscillation. Will work on animations for acceleration and some more calculation pages.   

12/8/13 @ 1:30AM _Colin_ - Added density calculation. Shape is shaded based on how dense it is, white is rare while black is dense. Added input callbacks. Need to work on hiding input fields that aren't used for selected equation. Some mobile improvements, let me know if anything doesn't work on your device as I can only test it with my iPhone.

12/4/13 @ 5:30PM _Colin_ - Had to update to Bootstrap 3. Basic layout is complete, simple test nav bar works on mobile. Canvas is being placed on page. Probably don't need the text area to be that large but we'll have to see how it feels after we start to fill it with input fields.
