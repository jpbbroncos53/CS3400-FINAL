# Physics Application

Final Project for Kapenga's CS3400

### Updates

---

12/4/13 @ 5:30PM _Colin_ - Had to update to Bootstrap 3. Basic layout is complete, simple test nav bar works on mobile. Canvas is being placed on page. Probably don't need the text area to be that large but we'll have to see how it feels after we start to fill it with input fields.
